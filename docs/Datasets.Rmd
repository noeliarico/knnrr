##### Mammographic masses {#mammographic}

<!-- Binary > Mixed > Less than 10 --> 

Mammography is the most effective method for breast cancer screening 
available today. However, the low positive predictive value of breast 
biopsy resulting from mammogram interpretation leads to approximately 
70% unnecessary biopsies with benign outcomes. To reduce the high 
number of unnecessary breast biopsies, several computer-aided diagnosis 
(CAD) systems have been proposed in the last years.These systems 
help physicians in their decision to perform a breast biopsy on a suspicious 
lesion seen in a mammogram or to perform a short term follow-up 
examination instead. 
This data set can be used to predict the severity (benign or malignant) 
of a mammographic mass lesion from BI-RADS attributes and the patient's age. 
It contains a BI-RADS assessment, the patient's age and three BI-RADS attributes 
together with the ground truth (the severity field) for 516 benign and 
445 malignant masses that have been identified on full field digital mammograms 
collected at the Institute of Radiology of the 
University Erlangen-Nuremberg between 2003 and 2006. 
Each instance has an associated BI-RADS assessment ranging from 1 (definitely benign) 
to 5 (highly suggestive of malignancy) assigned in a double-review process by 
physicians. Assuming that all cases with BI-RADS assessments greater or equal 
a given value (varying from 1 to 5), are malignant and the other cases benign, 
sensitivities and associated specificities can be calculated. These can be an 
indication of how well a CAD system performs compared to the radiologists.

Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.

## Multiclass

### Categorical attributes

#### Less than 10 attributes

##### Balance Scale {#Balance-Scale}

<!-- Multiclass > Categorical > Less than 10 attributes --> 

This data set was generated to model psychological experimental results. Each example is classified as having the balance scale tip to the right, tip to the left, or be balanced. The attributes are the left weight, the left distance, the right weight, and the right distance. The correct way to find the class is the greater of $(left\_distance * left\_weight)$ and $(right\_distance * right\_weight)$. If they are equal, it is balanced.

##### Teaching-assistant

##### Abalone

Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age. Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem. 

From the original data examples with missing values were removed (the majority having the predicted value missing), and the ranges of the continuous values have been scaled for use with an ANN (by dividing by 200).
